# Contributing to Order Desk's Hacktoberfest2022 repository

At present, this repository was created for non-technical staff at [Order Desk](www.orderdesk.com) to learn GitHub and open source contributing in general.

If a PR is made from someone outside of the organization, as of October 2022, this will be rejected.
